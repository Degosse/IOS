# NIEUWPOORT 23:50 TIDE FIX - SUMMARY

## Issue Description
The Nieuwpoort tide data included a high tide at 23:50 (11:50 PM) that was incorrectly being assigned to **tomorrow** instead of **today** due to overly complex logic in the tide time assignment algorithm.

## Root Cause
The previous logic used cascading checks that looked for "evening to early morning transitions" and was assigning tides based on their index position and complex previous-tide analysis. This caused late evening tides (like 23:50) to be incorrectly classified as "tomorrow's tides."

## Solution
Simplified the tide time assignment logic to a straightforward hour-based approach:

### Before (Complex Logic):
```swift
// Complex cascading logic that checked previous tides, transitions, etc.
// Led to 23:50 being classified as tomorrow
```

### After (Simple Logic):
```swift
// Simple approach: Only very early morning hours (0-5 AM) are tomorrow
let currentHour = timeComponents[0]
let isForTomorrow = currentHour >= 0 && currentHour <= 5
```

## Fixed Assignment Rules
- **00:00 - 05:59**: Assigned to **TOMORROW** 
- **06:00 - 23:59**: Assigned to **TODAY**

## Key Fix
- ✅ **Nieuwpoort 23:50 high tide**: Now correctly assigned to **TODAY**
- ✅ **All late evening tides**: Properly remain in today's schedule
- ✅ **Early morning tides**: Still correctly assigned to tomorrow

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests that verify:
1. The specific Nieuwpoort 23:50 case
2. Boundary conditions (05:59 vs 06:00)
3. All time ranges for proper assignment
4. App builds successfully with the fix

## Files Modified
- `/Tides Belgium/Services/TideService.swift`: Simplified time assignment logic
- Test files created to verify the fix

## Verification
✅ App builds successfully  
✅ Logic tests pass  
✅ Nieuwpoort 23:50 correctly assigned to TODAY  
✅ All other time assignments work as expected  

## Impact
This fix ensures that users will see late evening tides (like Nieuwpoort's 23:50 high tide) in today's tide summary, providing accurate and intuitive tide information for Belgian coastal cities.

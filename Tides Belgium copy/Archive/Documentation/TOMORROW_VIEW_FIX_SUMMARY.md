# Tomorrow View Fix - COMPLETED âœ…

## Problem Summary
- **Today view**: Works perfectly (user confirmed)
- **Tomorrow view**: Showed graph but no tide data list

## Root Cause Identified
The `TideInfoView` was hard-coded to filter for only today's tides, regardless of what data was passed to it:

```swift
// OLD CODE - Problem
private var todayTides: [TideData] {
    let calendar = Calendar.current
    let today = calendar.startOfDay(for: Date())
    let tomorrow = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: today) ?? Date()
    
    return tideData.filter { tide in
        tide.time >= today && tide.time < tomorrow && tide.type != .current
    }.sorted { $0.time < $1.time }
}
```

This meant even when `TideService` correctly filtered tomorrow's data and passed it to `TideInfoView`, the view would still only display today's tides.

## Solution Applied
Modified `TideInfoView` to trust the filtering done by `TideService` and display all tide data passed to it:

```swift
// NEW CODE - Fixed
private var displayTides: [TideData] {
    return tideData.filter { tide in
        tide.type != .current
    }.sorted { $0.time < $1.time }
}
```

## Why This Works
1. **TideService** already handles date filtering via `filterTidesForSelectedDate()`
2. **TideChartView** correctly uses `selectedDate` parameter for chart filtering
3. **TideInfoView** now respects the filtered data it receives
4. Only filters out `.current` type tides (which aren't meant for display)

## Expected Result
âœ… Tomorrow view will now show both:
- **Graph**: Already working (TideChartView was correct)
- **Tide list**: Now fixed (TideInfoView updated)

## Testing Confirmed
- Backend parsing works: 8 total tides (4 today + 4 tomorrow)
- Filtering works: `showTomorrow()` correctly isolates 4 tomorrow tides
- UI fix applied: `TideInfoView` no longer filters by date

**Status: READY FOR TESTING** ðŸŽ¯

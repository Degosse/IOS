# Chart Display Optimization Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Range and Difference Information**
- **Removed**: `InfoPanelView` struct entirely
- **Removed**: "Today's Range" and "Difference" display sections
- **Benefit**: Cleaner, more focused interface that fits on one page

### 2. **Optimized Chart Layout for Single Page View**
- **TideChartView main container**:
  - Reduced spacing from `20` to `16` points
  - Reduced padding from `20` to `16` points
  - Removed InfoPanelView from the layout

- **Chart height optimization**:
  - Reduced chart height from `220` to `200` points
  - Set maximum height constraint of `300` points in ContentView

### 3. **Fixed 24-Hour Chart Display Range**
- **Enhanced chartData computation**:
  - Added extended data range (±3 hours) for smoother curve boundaries
  - Ensured chart displays full 24-hour period even if data points don't span the entire range
  - Maintained fixed X-axis domain: `chartTimeRange.start...chartTimeRange.end`

- **Improved data filtering**:
  - Extended start: 3 hours before display period
  - Extended end: 3 hours after display period
  - This ensures smooth chart curves that extend to the full 24-hour boundaries

### 4. **ContentView Layout Optimization**
- **Reduced overall spacing**: From `20` to `16` points between chart and tide table
- **Height constraints**: Added `maxHeight: 300` to ensure content fits on screen
- **Maintained accessibility**: All accessibility features preserved

## Result

The app now displays:

1. **Complete 24-hour chart view** that spans the full time range regardless of data point positions
2. **Single-page layout** that fits all content without scrolling
3. **Cleaner interface** focused on the essential tide information
4. **Optimized space usage** while maintaining readability per Apple's guidelines

The chart now properly shows the full 24-hour period from 00:00 to 24:00 (or the selected day's equivalent), with the curve extending to the chart boundaries rather than stopping at the first/last data points.

### Technical Details

- **X-axis domain**: Fixed 24-hour range regardless of data availability
- **Data extension**: ±3 hours beyond display range for smooth curve rendering
- **Chart interpolation**: Catmull-Rom interpolation for natural tide curve flow
- **Space optimization**: Reduced padding and spacing while maintaining 44pt touch targets
- **Accessibility preserved**: All VoiceOver labels and touch targets maintained

This creates a professional tide monitoring interface that efficiently uses screen space while providing comprehensive 24-hour tide visualization.

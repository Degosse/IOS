# Photo Import Feature

## Overview
The Receipt Organizer app now supports importing receipt photos from your existing photo library in addition to taking new photos with the camera.

## New Features

### ðŸ“± **Dual Photo Input Options**
- **Take Photo**: Capture new receipt photos using the device camera
- **Choose Photo**: Import existing photos from your photo library

### ðŸ”„ **Seamless Integration**
- Both camera and imported photos follow the same workflow
- Automatic cropping interface for precise receipt extraction
- AI analysis works with both camera and imported photos
- All existing features (date extraction, restaurant name, price) work seamlessly

### ðŸŽ¯ **User Experience Improvements**
- **Initial State**: Shows both "Take Photo" and "Choose Photo" options
- **After Photo Selection**: Shows "Retake Photo" and "Choose Photo" buttons for easy switching
- **Consistent UI**: Modern iOS PhotosPicker integration with native system interface

## Technical Implementation

### Updated Components
- **AddReceiptView.swift**: 
  - Added `PhotosUI` framework import
  - Added `@State private var selectedPhotoItem: PhotosPickerItem?`
  - Updated image section with dual input options
  - Added photo selection handling with async/await

### Permission Handling
- Uses iOS's modern PhotosPicker component
- Automatic permission handling by the system
- No additional permission configuration required

### Workflow
1. User taps "Choose Photo" button
2. System photo picker appears
3. User selects photo from their library
4. Photo is automatically loaded and processed
5. Follows same cropping and AI analysis workflow as camera photos

## Code Changes

### Import Statement
```swift
import PhotosUI
```

### State Variable
```swift
@State private var selectedPhotoItem: PhotosPickerItem?
```

### UI Components
```swift
PhotosPicker(selection: $selectedPhotoItem, matching: .images) {
    Text("Choose Photo")
}
.buttonStyle(.bordered)
```

### Photo Handling
```swift
.onChange(of: selectedPhotoItem) { oldValue, newValue in
    Task {
        if let item = newValue,
           let data = try? await item.loadTransferable(type: Data.self),
           let image = UIImage(data: data) {
            capturedImage = image
            selectedPhotoItem = nil
        }
    }
}
```

## Benefits
- **Flexibility**: Users can now use existing photos instead of only taking new ones
- **Convenience**: Import receipt photos taken earlier or received via messages/email
- **Efficiency**: No need to retake photos that are already available
- **Modern iOS Integration**: Uses latest PhotosPicker API for optimal user experience

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test photo import from various sources (Camera Roll, Recent, Albums)
2. Verify cropping works properly with imported photos
3. Confirm AI analysis accuracy with different photo sources
4. Test switching between camera and photo import methods

# ✅ Receipt Organizer - Error Fixes Summary

## 🛠️ All Errors Have Been Fixed!

I've successfully resolved all the errors in your iOS receipt scanning app. Here's what was fixed:

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Import Path Errors** 
**Problem**: Multiple files were importing from `@/utils/formatters` but the actual file is `@/utils/formatter.ts`

**Files Fixed**:
- ✅ `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- ✅ `app/receipt/[id].tsx` 
- ✅ `app/(tabs)/reports.tsx`
- ✅ `app/reports/generate.tsx`
- ✅ `app/reports/preview.tsx`
- ✅ `components/ReceiptItem.tsx`
- ✅ `services/pdfService.ts`

**Fix Applied**: Changed all imports from `@/utils/formatters` → `@/utils/formatter`

### 2. **TypeScript Style Error**
**Problem**: `components/Button.tsx` had incorrect conditional styling that TypeScript couldn't resolve

**Error**: 
```typescript
icon && styles.textWithIcon  // This caused type errors
```

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
icon ? styles.textWithIcon : null  // Now properly typed
```

### 3. **Environment Configuration**
**Problem**: API key was hardcoded and not secure

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Created secure `.env` file with API key
- ✅ Updated `services/geminiService.ts` to use environment variables
- ✅ Added proper error handling for missing API keys
- ✅ Added `.env` to `.gitignore` for security

### 4. **TypeScript Configuration**
**Problem**: Missing ES2015+ features and Node.js types

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Updated `tsconfig.json` with proper ES2015+ support
- ✅ Installed `@types/node` for better TypeScript support
- ✅ Fixed all ES5/ES2015 compatibility issues

### 5. **Dependencies & Versions**
**Problem**: Some packages were outdated for Expo SDK 53

**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Updated all packages to match Expo SDK 53 requirements
- ✅ Resolved peer dependency conflicts
- ✅ All dependencies now properly installed and compatible
